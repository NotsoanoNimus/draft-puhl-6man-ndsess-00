        This section defines the purposes, goals, and mechanisms motivating end-to-end ND sessions.

      <section anchor="summary-overview">
        <name>Design Overview</name>
        <t>
          ND sessions are a "weak" security solution driven by cryptographic hashing. They trade simplicity, ease of use, and
          first-come-first-serve trust for a lack of complex public-key cryptography, infrastructure, signatures, et al. They
          are used to bind two exchanged, perishable secrets to a specific NDAR exchange between two nodes on the same network.
          The revelation of a secret causes its immediate expiration. ND Sessions DO NOT guarantee the ownership of an IP address:
          they only guarantee the legitimacy of NDAR and NUD packets exchanged within an established, ongoing session.
        </t>
        <t>
          Numerous suggestions have been made in the past to bind LLIDs to their interface IP addresses without requiring
          public-key cryptography <!-- ref? -->. These suggestions still find themselves
          vulnerable to Identity Assumption attacks on unsecure link layers. These attacks occur when a node goes off-link
          (either removed from the network maliciously, or by moving away) and a malicious node becomes free to assume its LLID,
          thus circumventing such address bindings. When this happens, malicious nodes are liberated to falsify and redirect NDP
          traffic in on-path attacks.
        </t>
        <t>
          To mitigate this, two nodes can establish private, unicast-only hash chains which can be used to prove each other's
          identities over a long-term and ongoing session. Hash chains are refreshed at random and each of the two participating
          nodes maintain their own 'perspective' of the session. Employing this cryptographic primitive empowers a session node to
          identify when the SP is being impersonated and to act accordingly. Adjustable session expiration windows
          also allow peer link-layer addresses to be recycled by new nodes in busy networks where neighbors may be more ephemeral.
        </t>

        <section anchor="summary-overview-goals">
          <name>Goals &amp; Tradeoffs</name>
          <t>
            ND Sessions seek to accomplish a few different goals:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identification. A session established with a legitimate SP is guaranteed to be continually legitimate through its
              duration, potentially ad infinitum if it is regularly refreshed. A malicious node therefore cannot spoof LLIDs or
              inject itself into any AR exchanges overlayed by ND Sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplicity. Avoiding reliance on public-key cryptography or Public-Key Infrastructure is highly preferred, as extra
              complexities demanded by these tools have in the past resulted in slow solution deployments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance. A fixed reliance on SHA-256 and very simple concatenate-and-iterate movements lend themselves to
              drastically improved session performance on participating embedded systems. SHA-256 is perhaps one of the most
              ubiquitous hashing algorithms <!-- ref -->,
              while also being significantly collision-resistant <!-- ref -->.
            </li>
            <li>
              Privacy. Sessions are end-to-end and do not rely on a centralized infrastructure to communicate registration
              information or other parameters. The use of RHCR ensures the privacy and protection of root session passwords
              at all times, while also rendering packet replay attackings infeasible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexibility. Nodes can opt into or out of sessions at any time by disregarding packet options, depending on
              their interface configuration and implementation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
            These goals must necessarily be accomplished by trading off some other features granted by more complex solutions.
            Drawbacks of using NDSOs, as opposed to more mature specifications, include:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Temporality. Expirations are imposed on sessions after considerably long (and adjustable) durations. Any malicious node
              taking advantage of expiration windows could successfully snipe link sessions and therefore lock out legitimate hosts
              from communicating using the resolved Target Address. <xref target="security"/> explores this in more detail.
            </li>
            <li>
              Disconnectedness. Any participating session node who either (1) is maliciously locked out of the session by letting it expire,
              or (2) fails to persist session details properly, will suffer from a long-term state of disconnectedness from the previous
              SP. This is because the other end of the session cannot permit flexibility in establishing new sessions for the same NC entry.
            </li>
            <li>
              Disorganization. A tangled web of end-to-end sessions, when implemented poorly, can seem arbitrary and lead to many
              sessions being juggled by an interface at one time, depending on the number of sessions a given node has with its neighbors.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <name>Reverse Hash Chains</name>
        <t>
          ND Sessions use two-way RHCR to prove the ongoing exchange of all NUD or NDAR packets are still transacted between
          the two original session nodes. These reverse HCs were first theoretically applied to IPv6
          addresses in <!-- https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45807-7_3 -->.
          Chains are small and lightweight, but difficult to break thanks to the one-way nature of hashing functions.
        </t>
        <t>
          A 'reverse hash chain' consists of a series of one-way iterative hashes. The 'final hash' of the chain represents a terminal
          value which all ancestor hashes -- or 'links', to follow the chain analogy -- will arrive to after some applied 'Counter' value
          of iterations. The 'final hash' H<sub>counter</sub> is a public and essential ZKPP value for the verifying session peer to store
          persistently.

          The node creating the HC will be aware of its initial parameters. The first computed hash is known as the 'Root Hash' and
          is essential knowledge for deriving the rest of the chain links iteratively. The Root Hash then acts as a sort of 'password' to
          the rest of the chain, so it MUST be kept secret until the session's chain is nearly exhausted.
        </t>
        <t>
          Nodes can prove communication with an honest and genuine SP during a session by asking for an intermediate hash value
          they do not know yet. And once the chain is finished -- meaning (1) the RH would be next in line to reveal, (2) the RH is
          going to be intentionally given in order to move to a new HC early, or (3) the session is about to expire -- the RH is
          subsequently revealed in order to set a NewHash value. The NewHash value is equivalent to the FinalHash value of a new
          HC that is CounterMax iterations in length.

          In a two-way ND session, hosts are expected to exchange all required initial information for the corresponding node at the other
          end of the session to verify submitted session details. Once 
        </t>
        <t>
          The following list outlines some general requirements for two-way NDP Sessions:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information related to Session options MUST be stored persistently on-disk. It MUST NOT be deleted until the session expires.
            This information includes: local Root Hash, local Counter, local CounterMax, local ExpirationMin, remote Counter &amp; remote
            FinalHash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Session options MUST be used only with unicast ND traffic, with the exception of the initial multicast Neighbor Solicitation to
            find a target node's Target Link-Layer Address information. If Session options appear in any other multicast exchange, they MUST
            be ignored by receivers.
          </li>
          <li>
            SHA-256 MUST be used exclusively for all hash chaining and all subsequent verifications. Another hashing algorithm MAY supersede
            this appointment in future protocol amendments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Persistent sessions SHOULD only be used on stable networks where nodes are not frequently entering or exiting the network. Relying
            on the 'ExpirationMin' time for the session to expire without valid ND messages is almost always a better option because it is
            forgiving of potential node forgetfulness.

          A set of three Interface Configuration Modes (ICMs) is defined in this section. Having a few operating modes to choose
          from will help to foster adoption of the ND option, even in mixed networks.
          Interfaces MUST operate in any one of three modes affecting ND Session behaviors, chosen for the interface by the
          implementation's discretion or by manual configuration:

          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>Gregarious</tt> mode. Senders of NDAR packets MUST always attempt session initiation when a session with the
            peer is not already ongoing. Receivers MUST NOT require the SP to reciprocate with any
            acknowledgements or to initiate sessions.
          </li>

            <tt>Strict</tt> mode. Senders of NDAR packets MUST always attempt session initiation when a session with the

        This section contains a more detailed and specific example of RHCR, and how its values can be used as idempotent,
        one-time passwords to prove knowledge of a single root password (the Root Hash).
        The final calculated SHA-256 values are just bogus results; they are only written out to demonstrate the purpose
        of the HC in ZKPP and RHCR.

=========================================================
GENERATOR'S PERSPECTIVE:
  R   := A seed value from a PRNG or entropy source.
  c   := A maximum iterations count.
  e   := Expiration value of the session.
  i   := The current or tentative SessionID.
  p   := A fixed Salt value using C and other constants.

H_0   := SHA256(R || p)    <--- Root Hash
H_n+1 := SHA256(H_n || p)  <--- Intermediate Hashes

 If...
  R  =  "gbvouewihng398p44fijmv3o"
  c  =  5
  p  =  c || e || i  =  5 || 23 || 734453247

 Then...
  H_0 = SHA256(
         "gbvouewihng398p44fijmv3o" ||
         {0x05, 0x17, 0x2B, 0xC6, 0xDD, 0xFF}
        )
      = c36b2c9a...bc901395

  H_c = H_5 = [function 'H_n+1' iterated 'c' times...]
      = 7d730fee...4aac9926

* Any value H_n where {0 < n <= c} can be derived from H_0.

=========================================================
VERIFIER'S PERSPECTIVE:
 | "All I know is..."
    c    :=  5
    p    :=  {0x05, 0x17, 0x2B, 0xC6, 0xDD, 0xFF}
    H_c  :=  H_5  =  7d730fee...4aac9926

 | "To prove identity, the sender tries to give me H_4.
 |   I wouldn't have known this value prior to getting it,
 |   because hashes are irreversible."

    H_4  := a050d6b5...4bdc3801

 | "If I iterate function 'H_n+1' from n = 4 up to n = c
 |   (1 iteration), then the resultant hash MUST match H_c."

    H_5   = H_c = SHA256(H_4 || S) ==> 7d730fee...4aac9926
  
 | "The sender of H_4 clearly knows a hash I don't. It must
 |   be a host that knows the Root Hash. Valid!" (*)

 * At this point, H_4 is no longer a valid proof of
    identity because it has been used. H_n where n < 4 is
    now REQUIRED in order to continue proving identity.
