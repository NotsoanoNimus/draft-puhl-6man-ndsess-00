        Neighbor Discovery Protocol over an unsecure link layer does not allow neighbors to assert their identities
        between updates. Neighbor Cache entries can be overridden by malicious parties seeking to redirect or deny
        service to neighbors in attacks of trivial difficulty. Various protocols have been proposed or ratified using
        public-key cryptography to provide proof of identity, but due to their complexities or other factors they have
        not been widely integrated. Neighbor Discovery Session options use first-come-first-serve Zero-Knowledge Password
        Proof techniques to assert node identities in an end-to-end, opt-in process, without requiring complex
        infrastructure or a secured link layer.

      <section anchor="summary-overview">
        <name>Design Overview</name>
        <t>
          ND sessions are a "weak" security solution driven by cryptographic hashing. They trade simplicity, ease of use, and
          first-come-first-serve trust for a lack of complex public-key cryptography, infrastructure, signatures, et al. They
          are used to bind two exchanged, perishable secrets to a specific NDAR exchange between two nodes on the same network.
          The revelation of a secret causes its immediate expiration. ND Sessions DO NOT guarantee the ownership of an IP address:
          they only guarantee the legitimacy of NDAR and NUD packets exchanged within an established, ongoing session.
        </t>
        <t>
          Numerous suggestions have been made in the past to bind LLIDs to their interface IP addresses without requiring
          public-key cryptography <!-- ref? -->. These suggestions still find themselves
          vulnerable to Identity Assumption attacks on unsecure link layers. These attacks occur when a node goes off-link
          (either removed from the network maliciously, or by moving away) and a malicious node becomes free to assume its LLID,
          thus circumventing such address bindings. When this happens, malicious nodes are liberated to falsify and redirect NDP
          traffic in on-path attacks.
        </t>
        <t>
          To mitigate this, two nodes can establish private, unicast-only hash chains which can be used to prove each other's
          identities over a long-term and ongoing session. Hash chains are refreshed when required and each of the two participating
          nodes maintain their own perspectives of the session. Employing this cryptographic primitive empowers a session node to
          identify when the SP is being impersonated and to act accordingly. Adjustable session expiration windows
          also allow peer link-layer addresses to be recycled to new nodes in busy networks where neighbors may be more ephemeral.
        </t>

        <section anchor="summary-overview-goals">
          <name>Goals &amp; Tradeoffs</name>
          <t>
            ND Sessions seek to accomplish a few different goals:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identification. A session established with a legitimate SP is guaranteed to be continually legitimate through its
              duration, potentially ad infinitum if it is regularly refreshed. A malicious node therefore cannot spoof LLIDs or
              inject itself into any NDAR exchanges overlayed by ND Sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplicity. Avoiding reliance on public-key cryptography or Public-Key Infrastructure is highly preferred, as extra
              complexities demanded by these tools have in the past resulted in slow solution deployments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance. A fixed reliance on SHA-256 and very simple concatenate-and-iterate movements lend themselves to
              drastically improved session performance on participating embedded systems. SHA-256 is perhaps one of the most
              ubiquitous hashing algorithms <!-- ref -->,
              while also being significantly collision-resistant <!-- ref -->.
            </li>
            <li>
              Privacy. Sessions are end-to-end and do not rely on a centralized infrastructure to communicate registration
              information or other parameters. The use of RHCR ensures the privacy and protection of root session passwords
              at all times, while also rendering packet replay attackings infeasible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexibility. Nodes can opt into or out of sessions at any time by disregarding packet options, depending on
              their interface configuration and implementation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
            These goals must necessarily be accomplished by trading off some other features granted by more complex solutions.
            Drawbacks of using NDSOs, as opposed to more mature specifications, include:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Temporality. Expirations are imposed on sessions after considerably long (and adjustable) durations. Any malicious node
              taking advantage of expiration windows could successfully snipe link sessions and therefore lock out legitimate hosts
              from communicating using the resolved Target Address. <xref target="security-lockout"/> explores this in more detail.
            </li>
            <li>
              Disconnectedness. Any participating session node who either (1) is maliciously locked out of the session by letting it expire,
              or (2) fails to persist session details properly, will suffer from a long-term state of disconnectedness from the previous
              SP. This is because the other end of the session cannot permit flexibility in establishing new sessions for the same NC entry.
              See <xref target="security-lockout"/> for more details.
            </li>
            <li>
              Disorganization. A tangled web of end-to-end sessions, when implemented poorly, can seem arbitrary and lead to many
              sessions being juggled by an interface at one time, depending on the number of sessions a given node has with its neighbors.
              See <xref target="security-management"/> for a further exploration of this issue.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <t>
          ND Sessions use two-way RHCR to prove the ongoing exchange of all NUD or NDAR packets are still transacted between
          the two original session nodes. These reverse HCs were first theoretically applied to IPv6
          addresses in <!-- https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45807-7_3 -->.
          Chains are small and lightweight, but difficult to break thanks to the one-way nature of hashing functions.
        </t>
        <t>
          A 'reverse hash chain' consists of a series of one-way iterative hashes. The 'final hash' of the chain represents a terminal
          value which all ancestor hashes -- or 'links', to follow the chain analogy -- will arrive to after some applied 'Counter' value
          of iterations. The 'final hash' H<sub>counter</sub> is a public and essential ZKPP value for the verifying session peer to store
          persistently.

          The node creating the HC will be aware of its initial parameters. The first computed hash is known as the 'Root Hash' and
          is essential knowledge for deriving the rest of the chain links iteratively. The Root Hash then acts as a sort of 'password' to
          the rest of the chain, so it MUST be kept secret until the session's chain is nearly exhausted.

          Nodes can prove communication with an honest and genuine SP during a session by asking for an intermediate hash value
          they do not know yet. And once the chain is finished (see below), the RH MUST be revealed in the next NDSO in order to
          set a NewHash value. The NewHash value is equivalent to the FinalHash value of a new HC that is CounterMax iterations
          in length.

          <li>The current session Counter is at 1, meaning 0 (the RH) is next in line.</li>
          <li>The LLID of the sending interface has changed, and the change is tentative for the NDAR exchange with the SP.</li>
          <li>The sender decides the chain should be refreshed. Implementations SHOULD do this at random when the Counter value

          In a two-way ND session, hosts are expected to exchange all required initial information for the corresponding node at the other
          end of the session to verify submitted session details. Once 
        </t>
        <t>
          The following list outlines some general requirements for two-way NDP Sessions:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information related to Session options MUST be stored persistently on-disk. It MUST NOT be deleted until the session expires.
            This information includes: local Root Hash, local Counter, local CounterMax, local ExpirationMin, remote Counter &amp; remote
            FinalHash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Session options MUST be used only with unicast ND traffic, with the exception of the initial multicast Neighbor Solicitation to
            find a target node's Target Link-Layer Address information. If Session options appear in any other multicast exchange, they MUST
            be ignored by receivers.
          </li>
          <li>
            SHA-256 MUST be used exclusively for all hash chaining and all subsequent verifications. Another hashing algorithm MAY supersede
            this appointment in future protocol amendments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Persistent sessions SHOULD only be used on stable networks where nodes are not frequently entering or exiting the network. Relying
            on the 'ExpirationMin' time for the session to expire without valid ND messages is almost always a better option because it is
            forgiving of potential node forgetfulness.
          </li>
        </ul>

          NDP Sessions are visualized in the following figure:

        </figure>
        <t>
          An ND Session is a long-term exchange bound to one single instance of NDAR between a set of LLIDs and IP addresses.
          Changing any of those four variables will necessitate a new Session be formed. A per-session,
          random password is chosen on each session node, whose hash value is repeatedly iterated with a salt value consisting of
          session variables and then given to the session peer. Nodes can prove knowledge of their initial passwords in each ND
          message by slowly revealing each one-time-use 'ancestor' hash in the iteration chain, going back to the Root Hash. See
          the specification <!- ref -> for more information about the inner workings of ND Sessions.
        </t>
        <t>
          ZKPP-based sessions therefore provide strong protection against Identity Assumption attacks occurring in the middle
          of a communication between two neighbors. They are still susceptible to impersonations at the very start of the ND
          Session, but this would require a very opportunistic and reactive attacker, since Sessions can last up to days at a time
          without any update. Implementing ND Session options with VBAs, then, simply (again) shims the NDAR process with
          Session options. Such implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> always validate the underlying session BEFORE processing any VBA verifications.

* Each time a new NDSO is sent, the sending HC's ratchet MUST 'tick'
   once to decrement the counter value.
* When the ratchet reaches 0, or the HC is finished, a new one is made.
* These ratchets are NOT REQUIRED to be synchronized with each other.
   This is why each session node stores information about both.

        <name>Interface Configurations</name>
        <t>
          A set of three Interface Configuration Modes (ICMs) is defined in this section. Having a few operating modes to choose
          from will help to foster adoption of the ND option, even in mixed networks.
          Interfaces MUST operate in any one of three modes affecting ND Session behaviors, chosen for the interface by the
          implementation's discretion or by manual configuration:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <tt>Ignore</tt> mode. Senders of NDSOs MUST NOT initiate new sessions.
            Receviers MUST NOT acknowledge any NDSOs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>Gregarious</tt> mode. Senders of NDAR packets MUST always attempt session initiation when a session with the
            peer is not already ongoing. Receivers MUST NOT require the SP to reciprocate with any
            acknowledgements or to initiate sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>Strict</tt> mode. Senders of ND packets MUST always attempt session initiation when a session with the
            peer is not already ongoing. Receivers MUST ignore ND packets if they do not contains NDSOs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          ND Session compatibility and features MAY be disabled on interfaces at any time and for any reason, but doing so
          will cause the disruption of all current sessions in which that interface was a peer node. This might create communication
          problems for other nodes

        It is useful to first create some context before presenting the process of a legitimate session.
        Node A (N<sub>a</sub>) is the soliciting node initiating the session while Node B (N<sub>b</sub>) is the receiving and accepting node.
        N<sub>a</sub> is used as the point of reference when discussing the session's details, so it is termed the Session Interface (SI).
        Since N<sub>b</sub> is relatively "across" the session from N<sub>a</sub>, it is termed the Session Peer (SP).
      </t>
      <ul spacing="compact">
        <li>N<sub>a</sub> has IP address <tt>2001:db8::12bc:8090/64</tt> with an interface LLID of <tt>3B-55-0C-00-12-33</tt>.</li>

      </ul>
      <t>
        N<sub>a</sub> would like to perform NDAR for N<sub>b</sub>'s IP address in order to forward link-layer frames to the correct address.
        Since both interfaces are using a Strict configuration, no ND packets will be accepted without valid attached NDSOs.

      <name>Transition Considerations</name>
      <t>
        Transitioning to network-wide use of ND Sessions is fairly simple no matter the deployment. It is a matter of properly
        adjusting the configuration of each interface on-link to accommodate the capabilities of their neighbors.
      </t>
      <t>
        The majority of nodes SHOULD start in the Ignore ICM when they are not ready to parse any NDSOs. Nodes SHOULD NOT ever
        be in the Strict ICM while being a member of a transitioning network, because encountering a node without support for
        NDSOs will make NDAR processes fail consistently. As more nodes become capable of managing ND Sessions, the Gregarious
        mode SHOULD be gradually introduced to have "pockets" of successful sessions. Once those are proven to function, pockets
        of devices with Strict ICMs configured could work without issue.
      </t>
      <t>
        Ultimately, a successful transition to using enforced ND Sessions on a local network is accomplished by gradually sweeping
        all nodes from the Ignore ICM through to the Strict ICM, as the deployment situation and network infrastructure permits.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="privacy">
      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>
        ND Sessions do not pose a risk to user privacy because all session details are attached as options on packets which
        are not intended to leave (or leak from the local network). Acquisition or eavesdropping on NDSOs does not afford an
        attacker or tracker any extra information about a target which would be valuable. This is especially true when considering
        the end-to-end nature of ND Sessions: NDSO attachments are always unique depending on the participants of the session
        being observed.

      <name>Reverse Hash Chain: A Concrete Example</name>
      <t>
        This section contains a more detailed and specific example of RHCR, and how its values can be used as idempotent,
        one-time passwords to prove knowledge of a single root password (the Root Hash).
        The final calculated SHA-256 values are bogus values; they are only written out to demonstrate the purpose
        of the HC in ZKPP and RHCR.

GENERATOR'S PERSPECTIVE:
  R   := A seed value from a PRNG or entropy source.
  c   := A maximum iterations count.
  e   := Expiration value of the session.
  i   := The current or tentative SessionID.
  L   := The current or tentative LLID of the sender.
  A   := The current or tentative IP address of the sender.
  p   := A fixed Salt value using C and other constants.

H_0   := SHA256(R || p)    <--- Root Hash
H_n+1 := SHA256(H_n || p)  <--- Intermediate Hashes

 If...
  R  =  "gbvouewihng398p44fijmv3o"
  c  =  5
  p  =  c || e || i || L || A
          = 5 || 23
              || 734453247 
              || 11-22-33-44-55-66
              || fe80::1234:5678

 Then...
  H_0 = SHA256(
         "gbvouewihng398p44fijmv3o" ||
         {0x05, 0x17, 0x2B, 0xC6, 0xDD, 0xFF, 0x11, 0x22,
            0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0xFE, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00,
            0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
            0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78}
        )
      = c36b2c9a...bc901395

  H_c = H_5 = [function 'H_n+1' iterated 'c' times...]
      = 7d730fee...4aac9926

* Any value H_n where {0 < n <= c} can be derived from H_0.

=========================================================
VERIFIER'S PERSPECTIVE:
 | "What I know is..."
    c    :=  5
    e    :=  23
    L_SP :=  11-22-33-44-55-66
    A_SP :=  fe80::1234:5678
    H_c  :=  H_5  =  7d730fee...4aac9926

 | "I can also construct the Salt..."
    p    :=  {0x05, 0x17, ..., 0x56, 0x78}

 | "To prove its identity, the Session Peer should send H_4.
 |   I wouldn't know this value prior to getting it, because
 |   hashes are irreversible."

    H_4  := a050d6b5...4bdc3801

 | "If I iterate function 'H_n+1' from n = 4 up to n = c
 |   (1 iteration), then the resultant hash MUST match H_c."

    H_5   = H_c = SHA256(H_4 || p)  ==>  7d730fee...4aac9926
  
 | "The sender of H_4 clearly knows a hash I do not. It is
 |   probably a host that knows the Root Hash. Valid!" (*)

 * At this point, H_4 is no longer a valid proof of
    identity because it has been used. H_n where n < 4 is
    now REQUIRED in order to continue proving identity.
